# **The FOSS Pluralism Manifesto**

*(Against CoC-as-CCCP)*

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) was born free: anyone can join, anyone can fork, anyone can argue.
Its strength is pluralism â€” different people, different ideas, clashing and combining to make better software.

We reject Codes of Conduct turned into tools of conformity or political policing.
We stand for:

* **Respect for people, critique of ideas.**
* **Space for disagreement, even strong dissent.**
* **No exclusion for beliefs, only for harassment or personal attacks.**
* **Transparency and fairness in moderation.**
* **Forking as the ultimate right when consensus fails.**

This FOSS community will not silence you for thinking differently.
It will only stop those who harass, exclude, or attack people instead of ideas.

**Freedom first. Pluralism always. FOSS forever.**
